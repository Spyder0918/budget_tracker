# Budget Tracker

## This is a simple command-line project used to track your budget.

**Run the program**:
1. Clone the repository to a local folder
2. Run `python3 app.py` in the terminal

### Features

- This program creates a JSON file called budget-data.json to store your added financial information.
- Each time the program is run, it will look for that JSON file in the project folder or create a new JSON file if not found.

### How it works

- You have three options to choose from in the terminal:
1. Add Expense
2. View Expense
3. Exit

### Add Expense
- Enter a category.
This can be anything from "gas" to "groceries", whatever you choose

- Choose amount.
Enter the amount of the expense. If gas costs #32.50, add 32.50. (The $ will be added automatically.)

- Enter Description
  Add any description to help you remember what that expense was.

### View Expense
This displays the saved expenses that were saved to the JSON file.

### Exit
This exits the program with a "Goodbye"
